function [featureVector , keypoints] = extractHOGFeatures(I, varargin)
// This function is used to extract features from an image.
//
// Calling Sequence
// im = imread(image);
// feat = extractHOGFeatures(im)
// feat = extractHOGFeatures(im,name,value)
// feat = extractHOGFeatures(im,"cellsize",cellsize)
// feat = extractHOGFeatures(im,"cellsize",cellsize,"BlockSize",Blocksize,)
// feat = extractHOGFeatures(im,"cellsize",cellsize,"BlockSize",Blocksize,"BlockOverlap",BlockOverlap)
// feat = extractHOGFeatures(im,"cellsize",cellsize,"BlockSize",Blocksize,"BlockOverlap",BlockOverlap,"NumBins",Numbins)
//
// Parameters
// feat : Feature matrix returned by obtaining features from a particular image.
// cellsize : The size of the cell specified by the user for extractng features.
// Blocksize : The dimensions of the block containing multiplte cells for feature extraction. An image comprises of multiple blocks
// BlockOverlap :  This matrix specifies the dimension of the block which moves or traverses across an image for feature extraction.
// Numbins :  Number of bins.The histogram contains 9 bins corresponding to angles 0, 20, 40 â€¦ 160.
//
// Description
// feat = extractHOGFeatures(I) returns extracted HOG features from a truecolor or grayscale input image, I. The features are returned in a 1-by-N vector,where N is the HOG feature length. 
//
// Examples
// i = imread('download.jpg')
// tr = extractHOGFeatures(i);
// tr1 = extractHOGFeatures(i,"CellSize",[8,8]);
// tr2 = extractHOGFeatures(i,"CellSize",[8,8],"BlockSize",[16,16]);
// tr3 = extractHOGFeatures(i,"CellSize",[8,8],"BlockSize",[16,16],"BlockOverlap",[8,8]);
// tr4 = extractHOGFeatures(i,"CellSize",[8,8],"BlockSize",[16,16],"BlockOverlap",[8,8],"NumBins",9);
